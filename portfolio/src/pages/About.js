                <p class="mb-3 text-white dark:text-gray-400">When deciding what career to go into, I knew I wanted to work on the cutting edge of technology and be a part of new innovations that generations will benefit from years after Iâ€™m around. I am a firm believer that timing plays a crucial role in this, and it is clear that now is the time for Artificial Intelligence. I also tend to think that the AI revolution will be unlike any other technology revolution before, in that, it is the first time we are creating something that is intrinsically creative itself (compared to past revolutions revolving around increasing production speed).</p>
                <p class="mb-3 text-white dark:text-gray-400">Because of this, and also unlike past revolutions throughout history, I think the AI revolution has the possibility to disrupt more jobs than it will actually create. However I believe it will be a turning point in humanity and how it operates (similar to how the agricultural revolution made hunters and gatherers obsolete, but changed how people live their lives). The idea that we are living in a time of innovation that will be remembered for generations to come fuels my passion for learning AI. Hopefully, it will be remembered in a good way ðŸ™‚.</p>

                <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"> Outside of school I enjoy playing sports, and have enjoyed it my whole life. From a young age I was a competitive hockey player, playing as high as AA GTHL for some time before focusing on school. Unfortunately, I am an avid Leafs fan and have suffered from it my whole life as well ðŸ˜†.  </p>
                <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">More recently, I picked up basketball and it became one of my biggest hobbies. Starting in grade 10, I practiced as much as I could in hopes to be impactful on the highschool basketball team. By my senior year, I had become the starting center and helped bring my school to its first city championship, in Division 1, in over 100 years at Parkdale Collegiate Institute. During this, university scouts started calling me and coming to our games to evaluate my abilities. This is 
                    one of my best memories in school because it showed me how hard work pays off, and this is a lesson I plan to bring with me throughout my life.
